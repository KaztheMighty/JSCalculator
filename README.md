# JS Calculator
A small Javascript Calculator that I thought I should put online to save the code. Honestly don't remember when I made this, I think the date is in the code somewhere for clarity.

It's direct a copy of the numpad I have on my current keyboard, minus the Num Lock key since it doesn't have any business being on a calculator.
